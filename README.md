# Video Project Editor

In order to manage video projects, this editor.

A project has classic metadata such as a name, an author, a creation date, the number of views, a description, and a type (automated or manually edited by an editor).

The projects can be deleted only if they are archived first.

First, the front-end interface is created to visualize and perform actions on them (editing, archiving, deleting).

Later on, the projects will be stored in a database and available through a dedicated API.
